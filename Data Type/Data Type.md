Python Data Types

Data types in Python are a way to classify data items. They represent the kind of value, which determines what operations can be performed on that data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.

The following are standard or built-in data types in Python:

Numeric: int, float, complex

Sequence Type: string, list, tuple

Mapping Type: dict

Boolean: bool

Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview


 Numeric Data Types
 
Python numbers represent data that has a numeric value. A numeric value can be an integer, a floating number or even a complex number. These values are defined as int, float and complex classes.

Integers: value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fractions or decimals). There is no limit to how long an integer value can be.

Float: value is represented by float class. It is a real number with a floating-point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.

Complex Numbers: It is represented by a complex class. It is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example - 2+3j
