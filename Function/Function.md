# Python Functions

Python Functions are a block of statements that does a specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

**Declaring and Calling a Function**
When we make a function, we call it declaring a function. When we start using the it, we call it calling or invoking a function. Function can be declared with or without parameters.

# syntax
# Declaring a function
```py
def function_name():
    codes
    codes
# Calling a function
function_name()
```
# Example
```py
def fun():
    print("Welcome all of you")
```

# Calling a Function
After creating a function in Python we can call it by using the name of the functions followed by parenthesis containing parameters of that particular function.
```py
def fun():
    print("Welcome all of you")
    
fun() # Driver code to call a function
```
