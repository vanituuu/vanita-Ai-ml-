# String

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. It can include letters, numbers, symbols or spaces. Since Python has no separate character type, even a single character is treated as a string with length one. Strings are widely used for text handling and manipulation.
**Example**
``py
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')

letter = 'V'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "Hello everyone.I am vanita"
print(sentence)
```
