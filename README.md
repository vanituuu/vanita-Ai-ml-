Introduction:

Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It’s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly. It is easy to learn and use

A high-level language, used in web development, data science, automation, AI and more.
Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.
Backed by library support, so we don’t have to build everything from scratch


Comments:
Comments play a crucial role in enhancing code readability and allowing developers to leave notes within their code. In Python, any text preceded by a hash (#) symbol is considered a comment and is not executed when the code runs.

Example: Single Line Comment

    # This is the first comment
    # This is the second comment
    # Python is eating the world
Example: Multiline Comment

Triple quote can be used for multiline comment if it is not assigned to a variable

"""This is multiline comment
multiline comment takes multiple lines.
python is eating the world
"""

Indentation in Python:

In Python, Indentation is used to define blocks of code. It tells the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to a specific block. All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block. Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line. The most common convention is to use 4 spaces or a tab, per level of indentation.
