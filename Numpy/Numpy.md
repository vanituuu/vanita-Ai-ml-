# NumPy  - Python Library

NumPy is a core Python library for numerical computing, built for handling large arrays and matrices efficiently.

ndarray object – Stores homogeneous data in n-dimensional arrays for fast processing.

Vectorized operations – Perform element-wise calculations without explicit loops.

Broadcasting – Apply operations across arrays of different shapes.

Linear algebra functions – Matrix multiplication, inversion, eigenvalues, etc.

Statistical tools – Mean, median, standard deviation, and more.

Fourier transforms – Fast computation for signal and image processing.

Integration with other libraries – Works seamlessly with Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.


Important Facts to Know :

NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be the same type, allowing efficient computation.

Vectorized operations in NumPy can be 10 to 100 times faster than equivalent Python loops.
