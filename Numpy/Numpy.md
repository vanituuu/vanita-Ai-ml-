# Python for Statistical Analysis

# Statistics

Statistics is the discipline that studies the collection, organization, displaying, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data. Statistics is a branch of mathematics that is recommended to be a prerequisite for data science and machine learning. Statistics is a very broad field but we will focus in this section only on the most relevant part. After completing this challenge, you may go to web development, data analysis, machine learning and data science path. Whatever path you may follow, at some point in your career you will get data which you may work on. Having some statistical knowledge will help you to make decision based on data, data tells as they say.

Data
What is data? Data is any set of characters that is gathered and translated for some purpose, usually analysis. It can be any character, including text and numbers, pictures, sound, or video. If data is not put into context, it doesn't give any sense to a human or computer. To make sense from data we need to work on the data using different tools.

The work flow of data analysis, data science or machine learning starts from data. Data can be provided from some data source or it can be created. There are structured and and unstructure data.

Data can be found as small or big data format. Most of the data types we will get have been covered in the file handling section.

Statistics Module
The python statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data. The module is not intended to be a competitor to third-party libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, or proprietary full-featured statistics packages aimed at professional statisticians such as Minitab, SAS and Matlab. It is aimed at the level of graphing and scientific calculators.
# NumPy  - Python Library

NumPy is a core Python library for numerical computing, built for handling large arrays and matrices efficiently.

ndarray object – Stores homogeneous data in n-dimensional arrays for fast processing.

Vectorized operations – Perform element-wise calculations without explicit loops.

Broadcasting – Apply operations across arrays of different shapes.

Linear algebra functions – Matrix multiplication, inversion, eigenvalues, etc.

Statistical tools – Mean, median, standard deviation, and more.

Fourier transforms – Fast computation for signal and image processing.

Integration with other libraries – Works seamlessly with Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.



**Important Facts to Know :**

NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning all elements must be the same type, allowing efficient computation.

Vectorized operations in NumPy can be 10 to 100 times faster than equivalent Python loops.

**NumPy Uses**

With NumPy, you can perform a wide range of numerical operations, including:

• Creating and manipulating arrays.

Performing element-wise and matrix operations.

Generating random numbers and statistical calculations.

Conducting linear algebra operations.

Working with Fourier transformations.

Handling missing values efficiently in datasets.

Why Learn NumPy?

NumPy speeds up math operations like addition and multiplication on large groups of numbers compared to regular Python..

It’s good for handling large lists of numbers (arrays), so you don’t have to write complicated loops.

It gives ready-to-use functions for statistics, algebra and random numbers.

Libraries like Pandas, SciPy, TensorFlow and many others are built on top of NumPy.

NumPy uses less memory and stores data more efficiently, which matters when working with lots of data.
